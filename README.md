# Coalition Technologies Test

## Description

The PSD to HTML conversion gave me a file from which I extracted the images. The instructions require the website to be fully responsive and for the carousel to turn into an accordion on the mobile screen. I'm using a snippet from bootsnipp.com to make the carousel responsive and bootstrap the accordion.
